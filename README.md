Parallel Odd-Even Transposition Sort

This project implements the Odd-Even Transposition Sort algorithm using C++ and OpenMP. It provides a complete framework for automated benchmarking, performance analysis, and report generation.

Project Structure

odd_even_sort.cpp: The primary C++ source file containing the sorting algorithm, OpenMP parallelization directives, and timing logic.

Makefile: The build configuration script used to compile the source code into an executable.

run_project.py: A Python automation script that executes the benchmark suite (Strong and Weak scaling) and formats the output into tables.

report.tex: The LaTeX source file for the final project report.

create_makefile.py: A helper script designed to generate a system-specific Makefile, ensuring compatibility with macOS environments.

Prerequisites

1. C++ Compiler & Make

Ensure that a standard C++ compiler and the make utility are installed.

macOS: Install via Xcode Command Line Tools (xcode-select --install).

Linux: Install build essentials (sudo apt install build-essential).

2. OpenMP Library

The OpenMP library is required for parallel execution. Note that the standard Apple Clang compiler on macOS does not include this by default.

macOS Installation:

brew install libomp


Compilation Instructions

There are two methods to compile the source code.

Option A: Using the Makefile (Recommended)

The provided Makefile compiles the code using C++17 standards and applies -O3 optimizations.

Execute the build command:

make


Upon success, an executable named odd_even_sort will be generated.

Troubleshooting: If the build fails with errors regarding "missing separator" or "omp.h not found", run the configuration script to regenerate the Makefile:

python create_makefile.py
make


Option B: Manual Compilation

If the Makefile encounters issues, you may compile manually using the following command (specifically for macOS with Homebrew):

g++ -std=c++17 -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -O3 -Wall -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lomp -o odd_even_sort odd_even_sort.cpp


Running Experiments

Manual Verification

To verify the correctness of the algorithm, run the executable with specific parameters:
Syntax: ./odd_even_sort <N> <Threads>

Example:

./odd_even_sort 20000 4


Output: N=20000, P=4, Time=0.1234s [Check: Sorted OK]

Note: The program includes a post-execution check to verify the array is sorted. If "[Check: Sorted OK]" does not appear, the sort was unsuccessful.

Automated Benchmarking

Use the provided Python script to generate the experimental data required for the report.

python run_project.py


This script will output two data tables:

Strong Scaling: Fixed input size ($N$), varying thread counts ($P$).

Weak Scaling: Increasing input size ($N$) proportional to thread counts ($P$).

Generating the Report

Open the file report.tex.

Locate the Experiments section.

Populate the data tables with the Time and Speedup values generated by run_project.py in the previous step.

Compile the PDF:

Online: Upload report.tex to Overleaf.

Local: Execute pdflatex report.tex (requires a TeX distribution).

Submission Checklist

Archive: Compress these files into a single zip archive named Project_YourName.zip.

Common Issues & Troubleshooting

1. "fatal error: 'omp.h' file not found"

Cause: The compiler cannot locate the OpenMP header files.

Resolution: Ensure libomp is installed. Run python create_makefile.py to automatically detect the library path and update the Makefile.

2. Speedup < 1.0 (Performance Degradation)

Cause: The input size ($N$) is too small relative to the number of threads.

Explanation: The overhead of thread creation and synchronization exceeds the computational time saved by parallelization. This is a standard characteristic of parallel algorithms on small datasets.

3. "Array NOT sorted!"

Cause: A logic error in the parallel region, typically a race condition.

Resolution: Ensure you are using the correct schedule(static) directive and relying on the implicit barriers provided by the #pragma omp parallel for construct.
